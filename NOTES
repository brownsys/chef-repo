Creating/installing Chef cookbooks on euc
-----------

<Commands to be executed on local machine>
* check out our chef-repo: git@github.com:brownsys/chef-repo.git
* install chef-client
  - sudo gem install chef --no-ri --no-rdoc
* knife configure
  - use defaults for everything except for chef-repo location, point it to the checked out copy of chef-repo
* knife cookbook create <cookbook-name>
  - browse to chef-repo/cookbooks/<cookbook-name>
  - make modifications and check in changes
  - simple ntp example: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Guide+to+Creating+A+Cookbook+and+Writing+A+Recipe
  - commit/push local changes to remote

<Commands to be executed on eucboss>
* pull changes on euc@eucboss
  - ~/chef-repo/
* knife cookbook upload <cookbook-name>
  - this adds the new cookbook to the chef-server
  - verify it now exists with, 'knife cookbook list'
* add cookbook to a specific node or role
  - 'knife role list', shows all current roles
  - 'knife role show <role name>', shows more info about this role
  - Add the new cook to role 'euc_node' with: 'knife role edit euc_node'
    + add cookbook name to run_list in similar format as others
  - OR you can add the cookbook only to a specific node:
  - 'knife node list', shows all nodes registered with chef
    + 'knife node show eucXX.euc.smn.cs.brown.edu', more info about this node and its recipes/roles
    + 'knife node edit eucXX.euc.smn.cs.brown.edu', add your cookbook to the run_list
* wait for the next chef install period, roughly every 30min
  - also you can check if the install is okay by restarting the chef-client on any node:
    + sudo service chef-client restart
    + then check the chef-client logs, should be at /var/log/chef/client.log
    + you should see your cookbook's name somewhere in here, near the bottom
  - I think there's a way to force a restart on all nodes, I can't remember how at the moment
