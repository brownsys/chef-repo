Creating/installing Chef cookbooks on euc
-----------
* check out chef-repo on local machine
* install chef-client on local machine
  - sudo gem install chef --no-ri --no-rdoc
* check out our chef-repo from git (local machine)
* knife configure
  - use defaults for everything except for chef-repo location, point it to the checked out copy of chef-repo
* knife cookbook create
  - make modifications and check in changes
  - simple ntp example: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Guide+to+Creating+A+Cookbook+and+Writing+A+Recipe
  - commit changes from local repo
* pull changes on euc@eucboss
  - knife cookbook upload <cookbook-name>
* add cookbook to a specific node or role
-  - knife role list (preferred method)
    + knife role edit euc_node
    + add cookbook name to run_list in similar format as others
  - knife node list
    + knife node edit eucXX.euc.smn.cs.brown.edu
    + add cookbook name to run_list in similar format as others
* wait for the next chef install period, roughly every 30min
  - also you can check if the install is okay by restarting the chef-client on any node:
    + sudo service chef-client restart
    + then check the chef-client logs, should be at /var/log/chef/client.log
    + you should see your cookbook's name somewhere in here
  - I think there's a way to force a restart on all nodes, I can't remember how at the moment
